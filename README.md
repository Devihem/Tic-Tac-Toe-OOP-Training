📑 **About:**

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ This is a basic project in python for the game Tic-Tac-Toe.
The idea of this the project is to be done with OOP construction.There are some additional
options added like custom board size , custom players size , gaming board, ai-bots, visualisation in terminal and option for new
games. For better experience all inputs are handled to stay repetitive until a proper input is received.*

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ The AI-Players behavior is based on the Monte Carlo principle for randomizing the choice every turn , based on the output of this randomized choices, the best random moves are collected and rewarded , after that is selected the one with highest score. The repetitions of the games is are based on the number of the free cells in the gameboard. The more free cell the more repetitions will be done( (x^ y) * z ).*

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Players take turns placing their tokens on the board by selecting coordinates in format Row:Col .
If a player has a row, column, or diagonal filled with his symbol the player wins.
If no player wins and the board is full, the game is considered a draw.*
